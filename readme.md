This repo is my personal blog. It uses [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) with [nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) and [liquid](https://liquidjs.com/index.html) for the website itself, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for deploying directly from this repo.

If you see any problem you want to report, please use [issues](https://github.com/matheus-rosin/somethingithought.today/issues); or if you want to debate a subject, please use [discussions](https://github.com/matheus-rosin/somethingithought.today/discussions). You can email me at **hi@somethingithought.today**.
